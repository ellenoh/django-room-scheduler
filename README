This is a simple room scheduling application which I wrote for a music
teaching and performance space in Brooklyn.  Notice that it's a "room"
scheduling application, and not a "rooms" scheduling application.
There's only one room, and the system is only set up to handle this
one simple case.

The teaching space's needs are fairly specific, so there's limited
value in open sourcing this application.  I'm doing it anyway, in case
it's of use to anyone building something similar.  Of course, I'd be
delighted if anyone was able to use it without much modification; but
I'd be happy enough if it saves someone a few hours.  That said, do
note that it's a bit rough around the edges in places.

This project has very few dependencies.  It works on Django 1.1---not
sure about other versions.  And it requires markdown.  

TODO

A lot!  But most important:

-Better and more comprehensive test suite.  Services added to the
-Overview section of the site to add repeating time slots and
-repeating reservations.
